# Threat hunting with Streamlit

## Description

This is my personal archive of threat hunting tools, POC's and demo's. All scripts herein have been developed with Linux users in mind.

## Installation

It is advisable to create a virtual Python environment for running these scripts, do as follows:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then whenever necessary, activate the virtual environment.

## Run scripts

Each script is designed to be runned through Streamlit in CLI (Linux):

```bash
streamlit run script_name.py
```
